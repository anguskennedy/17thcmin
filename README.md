## Foreword

This work is totally free to use and comes with a very liberal license. That
being said it did take time, effort and skill on my part to work out how to do
it and to put it together. If you get some use out of this work, and can afford
to, I'd would ask you to show your appreciation for my efforts using the Ko-fi
link above. If nothing else it will make it more likely that I'll continue to
work on the system.

Thanks in advance.

## Documentation

More information on the structure, content and capabilities of the system
